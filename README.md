<h3>The Drawing Room (VR Studio Space)</h3>
<br>
While conceptualized before the pandemic to provide studio visit experiences for friends, but as a consequence of lockdowns and travel bans made them release the first version in April 2020.

It is based on an open sourced VR platform called  aframe.js, accessible via web browsers. While have some limitations compared to high end softwares, it is just basically a website but
It is more accessible and requires no downloading needed.
koloWn called their VR space The Drawing Room.

<h3>In Real Life Physical Exhibition.</h3>
Drawing Room in Drawing Room

In Real Life or IRL an internet slang which denotes happening in actual existence in contrast with virtual and internet happenings.
"In Real Life" attempts to realize the virtual space in a real life non-digital world set up.
As evident in their practice of using open source web projects and internet ready mades, Kolown also created a series of tactile assemblages and collages from found objects.
The  series of assemblages they called the Prop paintings/objects are driftwood which were found after monsoon rains and typhoons during the lockdowns. Some of the wood was also part of the previous projects. Because they exist in real life and in the process of decaying, the driftwoods were treated and preserved with epoxy resins,marine epoxy and polyester body fillers.

They also produced collages from the found paper during their past travels and left over papers during the early days of their street art wheatpasting.

<h3>In Real Life: Drawing Room in Drawing poses the questions:</h3>

Is digital could be an alternative reality? 
<br>
Can we live in a digital world without the physical space? Is the process of digitization-realization and vice-versa normal human interaction?
<br>
How could they interact? What could be possible conflicts and dilemmas that would arise on this duality?
<br>
These questions are not only found sci-fi movies that we were watching but happening now In Real Life.
